		<h2>Special Software</h2>
			<p>The most important custom piece of software used at SN Works is the Gryphon content management system.  It was developed in house specifically to be useful in the quickly changing environment of college news.  Gryphon works with any device or browser size and all media files like photos videos or galleries are automatically formatted to play well with the platform to which you upload them.  Adding content can be done directly through the CMS, through FTP, or even emailed from the field.  Gryphon is also designed to work well with Twig in order to make it easy for the sites to talk to the database and vice versa</p>
		<h2>Open Source Software</h2>
			<p>SN Works uses a variety of open source software to support its operations. One of the big ones is Grunt. Grunt is a JavaScript task runner which automates repetitive tasks like compilation, unit testing and linting. The Grunt ecosystem is huge and grows daily as new plug-ins are being release all the time. Twig is another open source tool used at SN Works.  It is a template engine for the php programming language and greatly simplifies the development process by getting rid of the need for the developers to be fluent in php. Finally, another common piece of open source software used at SN Works is jQuery.  Its primary function is to render animations or effects that cannot be completed through css alone</p>
