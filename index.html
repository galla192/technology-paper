			<h2>Web Servers</h2>

				<p>SN Works does not use a solid metal in-house server system.  Instead, they use Amazon web services to host their content on virtual servers around the globe and they run Apache server software on all their servers.  There are two main server clusters, one called Stage  and one called Production. Stage is as its name suggests used to stage bug fixes and site changes so they don't break the live site. Production on the other hand, hosts the live sites managed by SN Works and is not widely accessible to employees.  They use a load balancer called HAProxy to make sure that requests are evenly distributed among the proper servers to avoid overloading a single one.  This allows for consistently quick server responses.</p>

			<h2>Special Software</h2>

				<p>The most important custom piece of software used at SN Works is the Gryphon content management system.  It was developed in house specifically to be useful in the quickly changing environment of college news.  Gryphon works with any device or browser size and all media files like photos videos or galleries are automatically formatted to play well with the platform to which you upload them.  Adding content can be done directly through the CMS, through FTP, or even emailed from the field.  Gryphon is also designed to work well with Twig in order to make it easy for the sites to talk to the database and vice versa</p>

			<h2>Open Source Software</h2>

				</div>
				<p>SN Works uses a variety of open source software to support its operations. One of the big ones is Grunt. Grunt is a JavaScript task runner which automates repetitive tasks like compilation, unit testing and linting. The Grunt ecosystem is huge and grows daily as new plug-ins are being release all the time. Twig is another open source tool used at SN Works.  It is a template engine for the php programming language and greatly simplifies the development process by getting rid of the need for the developers to be fluent in php. Finally, another common piece of open source software used at SN Works is jQuery.  Its primary function is to render animations or effects that cannot be completed through css alone</p>

			<h2>Deployment and Security</h2>
			<div class="content img-right">
				<div class="img-wrap">

				</div>
				<p>Deployment is handled through the Jira issue and project tracking system.  Issues/bugs are reported by clients and/or in-house and sent down a workflow from To-Do to In Progress to Internal Review to Ready to Deploy and then finally to Deployed.  This allows developers to work on issues without having to worry about navigating the mysterious labyrinth of git. In terms of security SN Works uses Dropear to create a command line ssh login for their employees to establish secure connections to the servers which are extremely difficult to decrypt.</p>
