		<h2>Special Software</h2>
			<p>The most important custom piece of software used at SN Works is the Gryphon content management system.  It was developed in house specifically to be useful in the quickly changing environment of college news.  Gryphon works with any device or browser size and all media files like photos videos or galleries are automatically formatted to play well with the platform to which you upload them.  Adding content can be done directly through the CMS, through FTP, or even emailed from the field.  Gryphon is also designed to work well with Twig in order to make it easy for the sites to talk to the database and vice versa</p>
